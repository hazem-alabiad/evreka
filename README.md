Assignment

**Notes:** 

 - Implmented Only q1 + q2. Buttons are not working. 
 - As I told you I have no real experience in FE or BE however, if you give more time I can implement the rest.
 - For the Controllers, I have just implemente `VehicleController` to show you my work but did not implemented `NavigationRecord` as both are not used.
   

**Used Frameworks & Technologies:**

 1. **BE**: Spring Boot with Java
 2. **UI**: Bootstrap & FontAweseom5
 3. **FE**: used some JQuery fucntions
 4. **DB** Postgresql@9.6

**Required tools to run the project:**
 1. IntelliJ IDE
 2. Maven Build Tool
 3. Spring Boot [CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started-installing-the-cli)

**Steps:**
1. Clone the project into a local folder
2. Using `IntelliJ` open the project and open up `Maven` plugin from the right sidebar
3. Wait a bit to let Maven resolve the dependencies 
4. Click on `Clean` then `Compile` then `Package` 
5. Run the executable then, go to the browser and type in [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) "the default port" to see the project live.

Best,
